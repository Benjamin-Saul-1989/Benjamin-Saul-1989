# Introduction

Originally from Australia, I have called Mexico my home for the past decade, having obtained permanent residency so that authorizes me to work in Mexico.

My journey in the Information Technology realm commenced with my graduation from university in Australia, where I earned a diploma in Information Technology, specializing in Networking and Security, alongside acquiring various other certifications. Beyond mere professional qualifications, Information Technology isn't just a career choice for me; it embodies my passion and fuels my drive for continuous learning and growth.

With over 15 years of dedicated experience in the Information Technology sector, I have had the privilege of accumulating a diverse set of skills and knowledge, fueled by my unwavering determination to excel in my field. Working alongside professionals from around the globe has exposed me to unique opportunities and perspectives, enriching my professional journey.

A staunch advocate of open-source software, I actively contribute to several open-source projects during my free time, believing in the transformative power of collaborative innovation.

Beyond the realms of technology, another passion that ignites my creative spirit is photography. Over the past five years, I have honed my skills as a photographer, capturing moments that resonate with emotions and narratives.

In essence, I am not just an engineer; I am a multifaceted individual driven by curiosity, creativity, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
